# Setup
You will need to have already plugged in the keyboard and have the HA automation webhook ID on hand.
1. Install git:
  ```
  sudo apt-get install -y git 
  ```
2. Clone this repo to the remote device:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/865charlesw/ha-remote-keyboard.git
  ```
3. Run the setup script (interactive at the end):
  ```
  ha-remote-keyboard/setup.sh
  ```
